once again I am attempting to do the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) this year.

this year, however, there's a twist. I'm currently traveling around New Zealand by bicycle and the only computing device I have with me is my phone.

so I'm going to see how well I can do just using my phone to do this.

since I'm just using my phone I'm going to take it easy on myself and use ruby for the language, as it's the language I'm probably most familiar with and I feel comfortable using it.

I'm using [replit.com](https://replit.com/~) for doing the actual programming and execution.
